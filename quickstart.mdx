## Overview

Set up your personal portfolio website inspired by Omkesh Narwade's showcase in under 5 minutes. This starter kit uses modern web technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX for easy content management. You'll clone the repository, install dependencies, launch the development server, and make your first edit to personalize the site.

The portfolio highlights skills in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, web technologies like React and Node.js, cloud computing with AWS and Docker, and design tools including Figma. Follow these steps to get a live preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Installation Steps

Follow these sequential steps to get your development environment ready.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository" icon="git-branch">

    Open your terminal and clone the official starter kit.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/omkeshnarwade/portfolio-starter.git omkesh-portfolio
cd omkesh-portfolio
````

    This creates a local copy of the repository with all source code, including sections for education, projects, certifications, and skills.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies" icon="package">

    Install the required packages using your preferred package manager.

    <CodeGroup tabs="npm,yarn,pnpm">

````bash
npm install
````

````bash
yarn install
````

````bash
pnpm install
````

    </CodeGroup>

    This fetches dependencies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX components. The process takes 1-2 minutes depending on your internet speed.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Development Server" icon="play-circle">

    Start the local server with hot reloading enabled.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm" icon="npm">

````
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn" icon="yarn">
````bash
yarn dev
````
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
